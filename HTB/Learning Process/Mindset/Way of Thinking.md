The field of information security is massive. It would be impossible for any one person to learn everything. No one wants to spend alot of time on a single area. Furthermore, this is not necessary. We will need some time to learn different technical principles, structures, and processes, but not years.

Every programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, if we can obtain a deep understanding of a single programming language, we will learn others much faster. We do not need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code. All of them follow the same principles which R. D. Tennent initially defined:
1. The Principle of Abstraction
2. The Principle of Correspondence
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness

In information security, we have to learn and understand these principles, structures, and processes quickly. Additionally, we have to adapt our knowledge to the various environments we encounter. We will have many situations where we will not understand how "it" works. That is good. At this point, we have to find out what we do not know.
