[[Think Outside the Box]] helps us cross imaginary boundaries and thus to access possibilities and options that were not recognizable to us at first. Thereby, we will encounter many options, and the whole way to the solution of a problem can become very complicated very fast. The Occam's Razor principle is beneficial for simplifying these circumstances. Occam's Razor is one of the central principles of modern scientific theory. The principle is based on the following definition:

> The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.

## Occam's Razor in Practice

Using Occam's Razor in theory sounds easier than it is in practice. We can state that the simplest explanation is the most probable. However, the fact is that apart from that, it is not always so. We must also distinguish between the individual details and mechanisms and the general picture or concept. In our learning phase (and thus also during our penetration tests against companies), we will encounter many situations in which we learn something new. However, it is crucial to understand the overall concept rather than the individual steps involved. For example, once we are familiar with SQL injection and how it occurs, we may find the individual steps difficult at first. However, once we understand the overall concept, it will be easy for us to discover when a web application is vulnerable to SQL injections.

If we have already dealt with SQL injections and know how they can look, we also understand that the individual steps to detect and exploit them can be very complicated. Nevertheless, what remains the same is the concept. The concept is the main focus when learning new topics.

Another example is the approach to penetration testing, which is very common throughout the cybersecurity community. Everyone discusses the cases that can occur and how best to approach them. Let us think back to Occam's Razor principle and think outside the box.

> The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.
