**Focus** is a vital skill to have. It is, however, a double-edged sword. In pentesting it refers to focussing on a subject for a specific time. When focussing, we are dedicating most of our thinking and attention on the chosen topic. Other thoughts are faded out.

On the one hand, so-called endorphins (happiness hormones) are produced by the body when doing workouts. These have different effects on the body, and one of them is the reduction of pain. Also, the chemical transmitters have a calming effect and ensure a restful sleep. Another function is the formation and regulation of hunger. We probably know the latter from sports. As soon as we have exhausted ourselves, the feeling of hunger comes. Another beneficial effect of endorphins is the strengthening of the immune system, not only on the physical but also on the psychological level.

The most significant stress is not in the body, but in the mind. As the focus turns away from the actual stress, we let go of the situations that have stressed us so much, and these are **subconsciously** processed and, for the most part, solved.

> You have probably forgotten where you put something, or you can't think of a specific term that is so obvious to you. Have you ever asked yourself why you can suddenly remember it after a short time?
