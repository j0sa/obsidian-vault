First step to documentation is determining the report audience. We will document our activities differently than we would present our results to a customer. The purpose of documentation is to present obtained information in a comprehensible way, so it can be reproduced.

The essential characteristics of documentation are:
1. Overview
2. Structure
3. Clarity

HTB recommends CherryTree and FlameShot. CherryTree is a tool for documenation, and FlameShot is a tool to easier make screenshots. Screenshots are very useful, as they can explain things better.

Guidelines to follow:
1. It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.
2. Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
3. Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.

Before we create documentation for our customers, we can clarify which points are most important to them.
