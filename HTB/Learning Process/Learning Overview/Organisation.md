The term **overview** is very important. **Overview** means that we should take all the necessary tool with us, like a lighter, knife, tent, and others, and set all the interim orientation points to avoid getting lost. As soon as we get lost, we cannot move disoriented, hoping to reach our goal. We will have to take a step back and reorient ourselves.

**Documentation** and **overview** are closely linked, as they depend on eachother. By documenting we have already made the first drawings on our map. These will help us to understand where we are and where we want to go. Being organized is significant in penetration testing because the entire report writing process has to be structured.
